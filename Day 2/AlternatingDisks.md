## Alternating disks

You have a row of 2n disks of two colors, n dark and n light. They alternate: dark, light, dark, right
and so on. You want to get all the dark disks to the right-hand end, and all the light didsts to the
left-hand end. The only moves you are allowed to make are those that interchange the positions of
two neighboring disks.

Design an algorithm for solving this puzzle and determine the number of moves it takes.
